        "text": "GIANNA JEWELERS creates unique and dramatic custom jewelry for that discriminating customer who is searching for something out of the ordinary. Capture your imagination whether the design is derived from an existing piece of jewelry, photographed or verbal description. Our staff at GIANNA JEWELERS can help you create a piece of jewelry that exemplifies your personal touch. Creating a unique design starts with the customersâ€™ ideas, their choice of metal and gemstone(s), their preference for a design style and their desire to have an original piece of wearable art. At GIANNA JEWELERS, we use CAD Design throughout the process of creating your one of a kind piece. This allows you to be able to view your design in 3 dimension and easily make any changes or additions as you choose. By allowing you to preview your piece in 3-D, your vision will become a tangible piece of art even before it is casted."
